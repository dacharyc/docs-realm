Overview
--------

When you enable {+sync+}, you must specify a {+sync-short+} mode for your 
{+app+}. The {+sync-short+} mode determines how users can access data 
from the {+service+} SDK in the client app.

You configure and use each type {+sync-short+} mode with different data.
You can't mix Partition-Based Sync and Query-Based Sync within the same 
{+app+}, so you must decide which type of {+sync+} to use in a given 
application.

Partition-Based Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` works best for 
applications where a subset of the documents in a synced cluster are 
related in some way and have the same read/write permissions for a given 
user. Those documents form a **partition**.

In Partition-Based Sync, you define a :ref:`partition key <partition-key>` 
whose value determines whether the user can read or write a document. 
{+service+} :ref:`evaluates a set of rules <partition-based-rules-and-permissions>` 
to determine whether users can read or write to a given partition. Realm 
directly maps a partition to individual synced ``.realm`` files. Each 
object in a synced realm has a corresponding document in the partition.

Choose Partition-Based Sync when:

- You don't need to create overlapping result sets
- Your data structure supports permissions at a partition level
- You want to release a production app quickly, while Query-Based Sync
  is still in beta

Query-Based Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Query-Based Sync <query-based-sync>` works best for applications 
where you need to define permissions on a per-document basis.

Choose Query-Based Sync when:

- You need to create overlapping query and result sets
- You want to apply permissions at the document level
- You need a flexible permissioning system to apply more granular permissions
